# certctl — Self-Hosted Certificate Lifecycle Platform

TLS certificate lifespans are shrinking. The CA/Browser Forum passed [Ballot SC-081v3](https://cabforum.org/2025/04/11/ballot-sc081v3-introduce-schedule-of-reducing-validity-and-data-reuse-periods/) unanimously in April 2025, setting a phased reduction: **200 days** by March 2026, **100 days** by March 2027, and **47 days** by March 2029. Manual certificate management is no longer viable at any scale.

certctl is a self-hosted platform for **end-to-end certificate lifecycle automation** — from issuance through renewal to deployment — with zero human intervention. Track every certificate in your organization, automatically renew them before they expire, and deploy them to your servers without touching a terminal. Private keys never leave your infrastructure.

## What It Does

certctl gives you a single pane of glass for every TLS certificate in your organization. The **web dashboard** shows your full certificate inventory — what's healthy, what's expiring, what's already expired, and who owns each one. The **REST API** (76 endpoints under `/api/v1/`) lets you automate everything. **Agents** deployed on your infrastructure generate private keys locally and submit CSRs — private keys never leave your servers. The background scheduler watches expiration dates and triggers renewals automatically — when certificate lifespans drop to 47 days, certctl handles the constant rotation without human involvement.

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shankar0123/certctl.git
cd certctl
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

Wait ~30 seconds, then open **http://localhost:8443** in your browser.

The dashboard comes pre-loaded with 15 demo certificates, 5 agents, policy rules, audit events, and notifications — a realistic snapshot of a certificate inventory so you can explore immediately.

Verify the API:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8443/health
# {"status":"healthy"}

curl -s http://localhost:8443/api/v1/certificates | jq '.total'
# 15
```

### Manual Build

```bash
# Prerequisites: Go 1.22+, PostgreSQL 16+
go mod download
make build

# Set up database
export CERTCTL_DATABASE_URL="postgres://certctl:certctl@localhost:5432/certctl?sslmode=disable"
export CERTCTL_AUTH_TYPE=none
make migrate-up

# Start server
./bin/server

# Start agent (separate terminal)
export CERTCTL_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8443
export CERTCTL_API_KEY=change-me-in-production
export CERTCTL_AGENT_NAME=local-agent
export CERTCTL_AGENT_ID=agent-local-01
./bin/agent --agent-id=agent-local-01
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Private keys isolated from the control plane.** Agents generate ECDSA P-256 keys locally and submit CSRs (public key only). The server signs the CSR and returns the certificate — private keys never touch the control plane. Server-side keygen is available via `CERTCTL_KEYGEN_MODE=server` for demo/development only.
- **TEXT primary keys, not UUIDs.** IDs are human-readable prefixed strings (`mc-api-prod`, `t-platform`, `o-alice`) so you can identify resource types at a glance in logs and queries.
- **Handler → Service → Repository layering.** Handlers define their own service interfaces for clean dependency inversion. No global service singletons.
- **Idempotent migrations.** All schema uses `IF NOT EXISTS` and seed data uses `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING`, safe for repeated execution.

## Supported Integrations

### Certificate Issuers
| Issuer | Status | Type |
|--------|--------|------|

**Note:** ADCS integration is handled via the Local CA's sub-CA mode — certctl operates as a subordinate CA with its signing certificate issued by ADCS.

| NGINX | Implemented | `NGINX` |
| Apache httpd | Implemented | `Apache` |

## Development

```bash
# Install dev tools (golangci-lint, migrate CLI, air)
make install-tools

# Run tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Lint
make lint

# Format
make fmt
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
make docker-up          # Start stack (server + postgres + agent)
make docker-down        # Stop stack
make docker-logs-server # Server logs
make docker-logs-agent  # Agent logs
make docker-clean       # Stop + remove volumes
```

## Security

### Private Key Management
- **Agent keygen mode (default)**: Agents generate ECDSA P-256 keys locally and store them with 0600 permissions in `CERTCTL_KEY_DIR` (default `/var/lib/certctl/keys`). Only the CSR (public key) is sent to the control plane. Private keys never leave agent infrastructure.
- **Server keygen mode (demo only)**: Set `CERTCTL_KEYGEN_MODE=server` for development/demo with Local CA. The control plane generates RSA-2048 keys server-side. A log warning is emitted at startup.

### Authentication
- Agent-to-server: API key (registered at agent creation)
- API key and JWT auth types supported; `none` for demo/development
- Auth type and secret configured via `CERTCTL_AUTH_TYPE` and `CERTCTL_AUTH_SECRET`

### Audit Trail
- Immutable append-only log in PostgreSQL (`audit_events` table)
- Every lifecycle action attributed to an actor with timestamp and resource reference
- No update or delete operations on audit records
- V2 extends to log every API call (method, path, actor, response status, latency)

## Roadmap

### V1 (v1.0.0 released)
All nine development milestones (M1–M9) are complete. The backend covers the full certificate lifecycle: Local CA and ACME v2 issuers, NGINX/Apache/HAProxy/F5/IIS target connectors, threshold-based expiration alerting, agent-side ECDSA P-256 key generation, API auth with rate limiting, and a React dashboard with 19 pages wired to the real API. The CI pipeline runs build, vet, test with coverage gates (service layer 30%+, handler layer 50%+), frontend type checking, Vitest test suite, and Vite production build on every push. 744+ tests total: ~520 Go test functions + ~138 subtests across service, handler, integration, connector, and domain layers, plus 86 frontend Vitest tests covering all API client endpoints, stats/metrics endpoints, utilities, and M13 operations. Docker images are published to GitHub Container Registry on every version tag via the release workflow.

### V2: Operational Maturity

- **M12: Sub-CA + DNS-01 + step-ca** ✅ — Local CA sub-CA mode (enterprise root chain with RSA/ECDSA/PKCS#8), ACME DNS-01 challenges (script-based DNS hooks for any provider, wildcard cert support), step-ca issuer connector (native /sign API with JWK provisioner auth)
- **M15a: Core Revocation** ✅ — revocation API with all RFC 5280 reason codes, JSON CRL endpoint, webhook + email revocation notifications, best-effort issuer notification, `certificate_revocations` table with idempotent recording, 48 new tests
- **M15b: OCSP + Revocation GUI** ✅ — embedded OCSP responder (GET /api/v1/ocsp/{issuer_id}/{serial}), DER-encoded X.509 CRL (GET /api/v1/crl/{issuer_id}), short-lived cert exemption (TTL < 1h skip CRL/OCSP), revocation GUI with reason modal, ~31 new tests
- **M13: GUI Operations** ✅ — bulk cert operations (multi-select → renew, revoke, reassign owner), deployment status timeline, inline policy/profile editor, target connector configuration wizard, audit trail export (CSV/JSON), short-lived credentials dashboard view
- **M14: Observability** ✅ — dashboard charts (expiration heatmap, cert status distribution, job trends, issuance rate), agent fleet overview with OS/arch grouping, JSON metrics endpoint, stats API (5 endpoints), structured logging with request IDs, deployment rollback
- **M18a: MCP Server** (V2.1) — AI-native integration, expose REST API as MCP tools for Claude, Cursor, OpenClaw, and any MCP-compatible client
- **M19: Immutable API Audit Log** — extend audit trail to log every API call (method, path, actor, status, latency), queryable via existing audit endpoint
- **M16a: Notifier Connectors** — Slack, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, OpsGenie notification integrations (parallel with M19)
- **M20: Enhanced Query API** — sparse field selection (`?fields=`), sort params, time-range filters, cursor pagination, `updatedAfter` for incremental agent sync, per-cert deployment history endpoint
- **M18b: Filesystem Cert Discovery** — agents walk directories, parse PEM/DER/PFX/JKS, report unmanaged certs to control plane
- **M16b: CLI + Bulk Import** — `certctl` CLI for terminal workflows, bulk certificate import from PEM files or network scans
- **M17: Additional Connectors** — OpenSSL/Custom CA issuer connector
- **Compliance Mapping** — SOC 2 Type II, PCI-DSS 4.0, NIST SP 800-57 capability mapping documentation

### V3: Team & Enterprise
